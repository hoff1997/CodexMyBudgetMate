### Revenue Projections

| Total Users | Paying Users (15%) | Annual Revenue | Annual Cost | Gross Profit |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1,000 | 150 | $17,982 | ~$2,700 | **$15,282** |

## Life Module Add-on

| Metric | Value |

| **Price** | $4.99/month or $49.99/year |
| **Average Revenue Per User** | $59.88/year ($4.99/month) |
| **Estimated Cost Per User** | ~$6/year ($0.50/month) |

### Revenue Projections (30% Attach Rate)

| Paying Users | Life Add-on Users (30%) | Annual Revenue | Annual Cost | Gross Profit |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| 150 | 45 | $2,695 | ~$270 | **$2,425** |
| 750 | 225 | $13,473 | ~$1,350 | **$12,123** |
| 1,500 | 450 | $26,946 | ~$2,700 | **$24,246** |

**Note:** Life Module has lower incremental costs because it primarily uses existing infrastructure (no additional Akahu fees, minimal extra database usage). This makes it a high-margin upsell.

## Assumptions

- **Conversion Rate:** 15% of free trial users convert to paid
- **Life Module Attach Rate:** 30% of paying users add Life Module
- **Average Retention:** 18 months
- **Akahu Costs:** Only apply to users with connected bank accounts
- **Infrastructure costs are estimates** based on typical usage patterns for Supabase Pro, Vercel Pro, and Akahu standard pricing

---

## Notes

- Free tier users still incur some infrastructure cost (~$0.50/month) but no Akahu fees
- Costs scale sub-linearly at higher volumes due to bulk pricing
- Life Module has minimal incremental cost as it shares existing infrastructure
- These figures do not include customer acquisition costs, support, or operational expenses
