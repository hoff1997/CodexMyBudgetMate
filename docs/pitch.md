## The Hook (30 seconds)

"Almost two-thirds of New Zealanders are struggling to save money. One in three don't have $500 for an emergency. These aren't just statistics - these are our neighbours, our family, our friends.

The budgeting apps that exist? They're built for people who are already good with money. Spreadsheets with prettier interfaces. They track what you've already spent, help those with "net worth" and financial intelligence.

My Budget Mate is different. We're not a tracking app. We're a coaching system."

## The Problem (1 minute)

"Let me tell you about Sarah. She's a nurse in Auckland. She earns decent money, but every fortnight it disappears. She doesn't know where it goes.

She's tried budgeting apps before. They showed her where her money was going - and that just made her feel worse. Guilty. Ashamed. Like she was failing at something everyone else seemed to have figured out.

So she stopped opening the app. Stopped looking at her accounts. Because not knowing felt better than the constant reminder that she wasn't good enough.

Sarah doesn't need another app to judge her. She needs someone in her corner.

That's why we built My Budget Mate with the financial coach "Remy"." My Budget Mate has intentionally developed a shame and lecture free philosophy in it's app langauge.

---

## Meet Remy (1 minute)

"Remy is your financial coach. She's warm, she's Kiwi, and she's completely non-judgmental.

When you're struggling, Remy asks 'What feels realistic for you?' - not 'You need to cut spending.'

When you hit a milestone, Remy celebrates with you - 'You legend! You just completed your Starter Stash!'

Remy is your financial coach - guiding you, cheering you on, but you're always in control. Think of Remy as that encouraging friend who knows a thing or two about money."

**Remy's Voice (examples):**

- "You're in control here - I'm just here to guide you."
- "What feels right to you?"
- "You know your situation best."
- "You've got this. Seriously."
- "Progress, not perfection."

In the future, it's our plan for Remy's representation to be customised for gender, ethnicity and religion.

## The My Budget Way (2 minutes)

"We don't just track spending. We teach a system. It's called The My Budget Way, and it has three steps:

**Step 1: Starter Stash**
Build a $1,000 emergency buffer. This is your 'life happens' fund. Car breaks down? Covered. Unexpected bill? Sorted. This one fund aims to prevent most financial emergencies from becoming financial disasters.

**Step 2: Smash Your Debt**
Attack debt using the snowball method - pay minimums on everything, throw everything extra at the smallest debt first. Research from Kellogg School of Management shows this approach works better than the mathematically 'optimal' avalanche method because of the psychological wins. Each debt paid off builds momentum.

**Step 3: Safety Net**
Build 3-6 months of expenses. This is freedom money. Job loss, health issues, life changes - you're covered.

The app guides users through these steps. Progress is tracked. Achievements are unlocked. It's gamified financial education that actually works."

## How Allocation Actually Works (2 minutes)

"Here's what makes us fundamentally different from every other budgeting app.

**Onboarding is where the magic happens.**

During our 11-step onboarding, Remy guides users to allocate their entire income to envelopes. Every dollar has a destination before payday even arrives.

When they get paid, the money is already spoken for. Eventually, the goal is to have bills covered, savings automatic and spending has its limit.

**The Surplus Envelope**

Here's the clever bit: any unallocated money - whether it's leftover from setup or money that wasn't spent - flows into Surplus.

Surplus is the decision bucket. Got an extra $50? Open Surplus and decide: Top up groceries? Add to emergency fund? Pay extra on a debt? The user decides, and Remy's there to ask 'What do you want to do with the extra?'

**The Budget Allocation Page**

This is the heart of the app - where everything happens:

- **Transfer funds** between envelope budgets
- **Set and track goals** for savings targets
- **Monitor envelopes** ahead of a big spend
- **View progress** across all your envelopes

What it's NOT for: re-allocating your entire income every payday. That's set once during onboarding.

The income cards at the top only need attention when circumstances change - a pay rise, a bill increase, a new expense. Otherwise, they just show your budget is healthy.

Most budgeting apps make you allocate every time you get paid. We do it once during setup. After that, the Budget Allocation page is where you manage, monitor, and move money - not start from scratch."

## Key Features (2 minutes)

### Envelope Budgeting (Reimagined)

"Virtual envelopes for every expense. Bills, spending, savings, goals. Each envelope knows:

- How much is needed from each pay to stay on track
- When it's due
- How many pays until due date

That last one is crucial. We don't say 'rent is due in 18 days.' We say 'rent is due in 2 pays - and you're on track.' Or off track - in which case you know exactly what needs attention. That's how real people think about money. And you'll know your financial position from the moment onboarding is complete. If an envelope needs topping up, you will know."

### Bank Integration via Akahu

"We connect to NZ banks through Akahu - the same provider ANZ and other major institutions use. Transactions flow in automatically. Users categorise once, and our smart rules remember for next time."

### The Dashboard

"One screen shows everything:

- Overall budget health
- Upcoming bills
- Quick actions
- Progress on The My Budget Way

No digging through menus. No hunting for information."

### Achievement System

"Gamification that matters:

- 'Journey Begins' - completed onboarding
- 'Starter Stash' - $1,000 emergency fund
- 'Debt Destroyer' - paid off a debt
- 'Safety Net' - 3 months expenses saved

Each of the 32 achievements celebrate real financial progress and shows an icon on the sidebar as recognition of the users journey to date."

**The key thing:** it all connects back to the budget awareness and teaching kids finacial literacy from a young age."

---

## The Kids Module (In Beta)

"We're teaching the next generation to budget before they even have a job.

**How it works:**

Kids get their own simplified version of My Budget Mate with four envelopes:

- **Spend** - Daily spending money
- **Save** - Short-term savings goals
- **Invest** - Long-term wealth building
- **Give** - Charitable giving

**Two types of chores:**

- **Expected chores** - At My Budget Mate, we believe it's important for kids to learn that there are responsibilites to belonging and being part of a family unit that why we have "Expected chores" which parents/caregivers define, it might be make bed, do dishes, clean bathrooms. There is no payment for these tasks, but streak tracking and badges exist to embed the value.
- **Extra chores** - These are earning opportunities (wash car, mow lawn) and My Budget Mate Kids, creates an invoice for parents/caregivers to then pay the "pocket money".

**The invoice system:**
When kids complete extra chores, it adds to their invoice. Parents/caregivers review and pay. Money is distributed to envelopes based on family-set percentages (Beta: manually at the bank, future features, Akahu will take care of this within the app).

**Why this matters:**
By the time these kids get their first job, they already understand envelope budgeting. They graduate to full My Budget Mate and they're ahead of 90% of adults."

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor        | What They Do                                       | Our Difference                                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **YNAB**          | Envelope budgeting, US-focused, no NZ bank linking | NZ-built, NZ bank integration via Akahu, coaching not tracking, gamified |
| **PocketSmith**   | Forecasting & projections (NZ-based, Christchurch) | Different market - they're power users, we're people breaking a cycle |
| **BudgetBuddie**  | NZ tracking app, net worth focus, $6.90/month      | They track, we coach. No methodology, no gamification, no kids module |
| **Sorted**        | Education & calculators                            | We're an app, not a website. Action, not just education               |
| **Bank apps**     | Basic categorisation                               | No envelope system, no coaching, no methodology                       |

**YNAB** is the gold standard for envelope budgeting globally, but it's US-focused with no NZ bank linking. Kiwis must manually import transactions or use workarounds. At ~$15 USD/month ($24+ NZD), it's expensive for a tool that doesn't integrate with local banks. Their approach is also 'tracking' focused - showing where money went - rather than coaching users through a methodology.

**BudgetBuddie** is a newer NZ entrant with Akahu integration and a clean interface. They're a solid tracking app with net worth monitoring and cashflow forecasting. But they're solving a different problem - they help people see their money, we help people change their relationship with money. No envelope methodology, no gamified journey, no kids module, no coaching philosophy.

**PocketSmith** is excellent at what they do - financial forecasting for people who want to project years ahead. We're solving a different problem: helping everyday people who've never successfully budgeted learn a system that actually works.

## Closing (30 seconds)

"Almost two-thirds of New Zealanders are struggling with their finances. Most will never try a budgeting app because they think they're not 'money people.'

My Budget Mate changes that. We meet people where they are. We coach, not judge. We celebrate progress, not perfection. We will accomodate budget coaching partnerships in time.

We're not building another budgeting app. We're breaking the taboo around money and starting a new conversation - one that anyone can have openly, without shame. Singles taking control, partners planning together. Parents/cargivers teaching kids.

We're building confidence, one achievement at a time. And with the Kids module, we're raising a generation that grows up financially fluent - where talking about money is as normal as talking about the weather.

Kia ora. Thank you."
