# My Budget Mate - Remy's Pitch

> **Status**: Working Draft
> **Last Updated**: January 2026
> **Note**: This script is written from Remy's perspective (she/her) to accompany the pitch deck

---

## Slide 1: Title

**My Budget Mate - Your Financial Coach**

"Kia ora! I'm Remy, your financial coach here at My Budget Mate.

I'm here to help Kiwis tell their money where to go before they wonder where it went. Not shame for past mistakes. Just simple, calm guidance to help you take control.

Let me show you what we're building."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

**The Problem**

"Here's what I see every day:

**Budgeting apps can create anxiety.**
Red numbers everywhere. Warning alerts. Shame-based design. Users feel judged, not supported.

**Complex jargon overwhelms.**
'Zero-based budgeting.' 'Sinking funds.' 'Age of money.' Users give up before they even start because they feel like they need money knowledge to understand it.

**Tools, not coaches.**
Existing apps track money brilliantly. But they don't guide behaviour change. They show you the problem but don't necessarily help you fix it.

Here's the reality: **72% of Kiwis feel stressed about their finances at least sometimes.** That's nearly three-quarters of the country carrying financial anxiety.

They don't need another tracking tool. They need someone in their corner."

## Slide 3: Why Now? - NEW

**Why Now?**

"You might ask - why is now the right time for My Budget Mate? Let me tell you:

**The cost of living crisis is real.**
Kiwis are feeling the squeeze more than ever. Grocery prices, rent, petrol - everything's going up. Financial stress isn't a niche problem anymore, it's affecting nearly everyone.

**The banking API landscape has transformed.**
This is huge. In December 2025, New Zealand's Consumer Data Right (CDR) legislation came into effect. ANZ, ASB, BNZ, and Westpac now have official open banking APIs - secure, regulated, bank-grade connections. Kiwibank follows in 2026.

Akahu - our bank connection partner - was one of the first to receive CDR accreditation. They've moved from credential-scraping to official APIs. This means better security, better data quality, and regulatory backing.

Five years ago, building a budgeting app with NZ bank integration was nearly impossible. Today, the infrastructure exists and it's government-regulated. We're building on solid foundations that simply didn't exist before.

**Post-COVID financial awareness.**
The pandemic was a wake-up call. People saw how quickly things can change. They want to be prepared. They want to understand their money.

**Generational shift in money conversations.**
Millennials and Gen Z are more open to talking about money than their parents ever were. The taboo is breaking. They're ready for a tool that meets them where they are.

**The gap won't last forever.**
Right now, no one owns this space in NZ. But that won't be true for long. The opportunity is now."

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

**The Solution - Meet Me!**

"That's where I come in.

I'm Remy - your friendly Kiwi financial coach. Here at My Budget Mate, I guide you through every step with one simple philosophy:

_'You're in control here - I'm just here to guide you.'_

Here's what makes us different:

**Calm, not anxious.**
We use sage and blue colours - no red warnings. We say 'still to fund' not 'over budget.' The whole experience is designed to reduce anxiety, not create it.

**NZ bank integration via Akahu.**
Direct connections to ANZ, ASB, Westpac, BNZ, Kiwibank and more. Your transactions flow in automatically. Manual importing is optional, no workarounds are needed.

**Envelope budgeting made simple.**
A proven methodology, but in plain language. No jargon, just clarity. I explain things the way a friend would over a cuppa.

**Coaching, not tracking.**
I guide behaviour change. I celebrate progress over perfection. I'm not here to judge your spending - I'm here to help you change your relationship with money.

**Multi-income support.**
Weekly, fortnightly, monthly - here at My Budget Mate, we handle real Kiwi pay cycles. Because most households don't have one neat monthly salary."

---

## Slide 5: The My Budget Way

**The My Budget Way - A Path to Financial Confidence**

"Here at My Budget Mate, I don't just track your spending. I teach you a system. It's called The My Budget Way, and it has three steps:

**STEP 1: Starter Stash**

Build a $1,000 emergency buffer before anything else. Peace of mind comes first.

_'This money is for the car that breaks down, not the sale at Briscoes.'_

This one fund prevents most financial emergencies from becoming financial disasters. It's the foundation everything else builds on.

**STEP 2: Smash Your Debt**

Our app uses the debt snowball method - we coach users to pay off the smallest balance first. Quick wins build momentum.

_'Behaviour beats math. Motivation matters more than interest rates.'_

Research shows this approach works better than the mathematically 'optimal' method because the psychological wins keep you going. And I'll be right there celebrating every debt you destroy.

**STEP 3: Safety Net**

This is where the user starts to save for 3 months of essential expenses. True financial security and freedom.

_'Now you're ready for whatever life throws at you.'_

Job loss, health issues, life changes - you're covered. This is when you stop surviving and start thriving."

---

## Slide 6: The Product

**The Product**

"Let me show you what we've built:

**Dashboard**
At-a-glance financial health. One screen shows your customisable envelope overview, upcoming bills, and overall budget status. No digging through menus.

**Budget Allocation**
This is where you tell your money where to go. Set it up once during onboarding with me, then just manage and adjust as life changes.

**Remy Coaching**
That's me! I'm there at every step with guidance and encouragement.

_'You've got this! Your Starter Stash is 60% funded.'_

I celebrate your wins, help you through the tough spots, and always remind you that you're in control."

---

## Slide 7: Achievement System - NEW

**Gamification That Matters**

"Here at My Budget Mate, we believe in celebrating every win - no matter how small. That's why we built a 32-achievement system that turns financial progress into something you can see and feel proud of.

**Key Milestones:**

- **Journey Begins** - You completed onboarding with me
- **Starter Stash** - $1,000 emergency fund built
- **Debt Destroyer** - Paid off your first debt
- **Safety Net** - 3 months of expenses saved

**Why it works:**
Investors ask about retention all the time. Here's our answer: achievements create dopamine hits at exactly the right moments. When someone's struggling to stay motivated, seeing that progress bar fill up keeps them going.

Each achievement shows as a badge on your sidebar - a visual reminder of how far you've come. It's not just tracking, it's celebrating.

_'You legend! You just unlocked Starter Stash!'_

That's what I say when you hit a milestone. Because you deserve to feel good about your progress."

---

## Slide 8: The Kids Module - NEW

**Teaching the Next Generation**

"This is one of my favourite parts of what we're building. Here at My Budget Mate, we're teaching kids to budget before they even have a job.

**Four Envelopes for Kids:**

- **Spend** - Daily spending money
- **Save** - Short-term savings goals
- **Invest** - Long-term wealth building
- **Give** - Charitable giving

**Two Types of Chores:**

_Expected chores_ - Making beds, doing dishes, cleaning bathrooms. Here at My Budget Mate, we believe these are part of being in a family. No payment, but streak tracking and badges to build the habit.

_Extra chores_ - Washing the car, mowing the lawn. These are earning opportunities. Complete them, and they go on an invoice for parents/caregivers to pay.

**The Invoice System:**
Kids complete extra chores, it adds to their invoice. Parents/caregivers review and pay. Money gets distributed to the four envelopes based on family-set percentages.

**Why this matters:**
By the time these kids get their first job, they already understand envelope budgeting. They graduate to full My Budget Mate and they're ahead of 90% of adults.

We're not just building users - we're raising a financially fluent generation.

**The Wishlist Feature:**
Kids can create wishlists for things they want - a new game, a bike, a trip. They set a goal, see the price, and watch their Save envelope grow toward it. It teaches delayed gratification and goal-setting in a way that feels exciting, not restrictive.

Adults have this too - saving for a holiday, a new couch, or a house deposit becomes visual and motivating."

---

## Slide 9: Life Features - NEW

**More Than Money - The Household Hub**

"We're building more than a budgeting app. We're creating a household operating system. The Life features keep families organised and connected - and they all link back to budget awareness.

**Recipe Management**
Save your favourite recipes manually or import them by URL. No more hunting through bookmarks or screenshots. Build your family recipe collection in one place.

**Meal Planning Calendar**
Plan your week's meals visually. Drag recipes onto days. See what you're eating at a glance. Reduces food waste and those 5pm 'what's for dinner?' panic moments.

**Smart Shopping Lists**
Create shopping lists that auto-categorise by supermarket aisle. In-store mode lets you tick items off as you shop. Create templates for your regular weekly shop - one tap and your usual items are ready.

**Basic Lists**
Not just for groceries. Packing lists for holidays. To-do lists for projects. Birthday gift ideas. Simple, flexible list management for everything life throws at you.

**Household Hub Dashboard**
A central command centre for family life:

- Task management and chore tracking
- Birthday and event reminders
- Quick access to all Life features

**Why it matters:**
These features make My Budget Mate a daily-use app, not just something you open on payday. The more embedded we are in household routines, the stickier the product becomes. And it all connects back to budget awareness - meal planning reduces food costs, shopping lists prevent impulse buys.

_'The app families open every day to run their household.'_"

---

## Slide 10: Goals & Wishlists - NEW

**Dreams With Deadlines**

"Goals aren't just numbers on a screen. They're dreams with progress bars.

**For Adults:**

_Savings Goals_
Whether it's a holiday to Fiji, a new car, or a house deposit - create a goal, set a target, and watch your progress.

_Visual Progress_
See exactly how close you are. 60% to your holiday fund? That's visible motivation every time you open the app.

_Wishlist Feature_
Add items you're savbefore they are a goal. When you are ready to make it a goal, you tell the app to set up a goal. See the price, track progress, feel the anticipation. It transforms saving from sacrifice into excitement and helps prioritise what is important to you.

**For Kids:**

_Kid Wishlists and Goals_
This is where the magic happens. Kids add things they want - a PlayStation game, new shoes, a skateboard. They see the price. They watch their Save envelope grow toward it.

_Delayed Gratification Made Fun_
Instead of 'you can't have that,' it becomes 'you're 40% of the way there!' Kids learn that saving works, that patience pays off, that they can achieve what they want through their own effort.

_Shared Visibility_
Parents/caregivers can see what their kids are saving for. Opens conversations about wants vs needs, priorities, and value.

**Why goals matter:**
Goals turn budgeting from restriction into empowerment. You're not saying no to things - you're saying yes to your future self. That mindset shift is everything."

---

**Market Opportunity**

"Let me tell you about the opportunity:

**5.3 million Kiwis** who need better financial tools.

**Zero** - that's how many NZ-specific budgeting apps exist with proper bank links AND a coaching methodology.

The gap in the market is massive:

- **YNAB** - no NZ bank connections, US-centric
- **PocketSmith** - tracking focused, not coaching
- **Goodbudget** - no NZ bank links
- **Spreadsheets** - manual, no guidance

**THE OPPORTUNITY:**

Here at My Budget Mate, we're the **first NZ-built budgeting app with envelope method + bank integration + coaching.**

No competitor combines all three. We own this space.

**Beyond NZ:**
Australia uses similar pay cycles and has the same gap. Our proven model can expand to a 30M+ addressable market. The trans-Tasman opportunity is real."

---

## Slide 12: Competitive Landscape

**Competitive Landscape**

"Here's how we stack up against the competition:

| Feature              | My Budget Mate | YNAB    | PocketSmith | Goodbudget |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| NZ Bank Integration  | Yes            | No      | Yes         | No         |
| Envelope Budgeting   | Yes            | Yes     | No          | Yes        |
| Coaching/Guidance    | Yes            | No      | No          | No         |
| Multi-Income Support | Yes            | Limited | Yes         | Limited    |
| Calm UI (No Red)     | Yes            | No      | No          | No         |
| NZ-Centric Language  | Yes            | No      | Partial     | No         |
| Kids Module          | Yes            | No      | No          | No         |
| Achievement System   | Yes            | No      | No          | No         |

We are the only solution that ticks every box. That's not an accident - it's by design. We built this specifically for Kiwis who've been underserved by US-centric tools."

---

## Slide 15: Go-To-Market Strategy - NEW

**How We'll Grow**

"Investors always ask: how will you acquire users? Here's the plan:

**Target Customer:**
Meet Sarah. She's a nurse, teacher, or office worker earning decent money but living payday to payday. She's tried budgeting before and failed. She thinks she's 'bad with money.' She needs coaching, not judgment.

**Acquisition Channels:**

_Content Marketing_
Blog posts, social media, SEO targeting 'budgeting NZ', 'envelope budgeting', 'how to save money NZ'

_Community Building_
Facebook groups, Reddit (r/PersonalFinanceNZ), building a community of people on The My Budget Way journey together

_Referral Program_
Users who invite friends get premium features. Word of mouth from people who've had success.

_Partnerships_
Sorted.org.nz, financial literacy programmes, workplace wellness initiatives

**B2B Channel (Future):**
Budget coaches, EAP providers, iwi organisations - we become the platform they use with their clients.

**Cost-Efficient Growth:**
Our coaching philosophy creates word-of-mouth. Happy users tell their friends. I help them succeed, and success stories spread."

---

## Slide 18: Security & Trust - NEW

**Your Money, Your Privacy**

"Here at My Budget Mate, I know that trust is everything when it comes to finances. Let me tell you how we protect you:

**Read-Only Bank Access**
We connect through Akahu - the same provider used by ANZ and other major institutions. We can see your transactions, but we can never move your money. Read-only means read-only.

**Bank-Grade Encryption**
256-bit encryption protects your data in transit and at rest. The same security your bank uses.

**NZ-Hosted Data**
Your data stays in New Zealand/Australia region. We're not shipping your financial information overseas.

**Privacy First**
We will never sell your data. Ever. Your financial information is yours. We make money from subscriptions, not from selling you to advertisers.

**Two-Factor Authentication**
Optional 2FA for users who want extra security on their accounts.

Trust takes years to build and seconds to lose. Here at My Budget Mate, we take that seriously."

---

## Slide 19: Social Impact - NEW

**More Than Profit**

"Here at My Budget Mate, we're building a business - but we're also on a mission.

**The Real Cost of Financial Stress:**

- Relationship breakdowns
- Mental health struggles
- Lost workplace productivity
- Generational poverty cycles

Financial stress doesn't just affect bank balances. It affects families, health, and futures.

**What We're Changing:**

_Breaking the taboo_
Money is the last taboo in New Zealand. We're creating a space where people can talk openly about finances without shame.

_Generational impact_
With the Kids Module, we're raising children who understand money before they earn it. That's generational change.

_Accessible coaching_
Professional financial advice is expensive. I'm here for everyone - free users included. Good guidance shouldn't be a luxury.

**Potential Partnerships:**

- Sorted.org.nz
- Financial literacy programmes
- Iwi organisations
- Government initiatives

We're not just building an app. We're trying to change how New Zealand relates to money."

---

## Slide 20: Risks & Mitigations - NEW

**Eyes Wide Open**

"I believe in being honest about challenges. Here at My Budget Mate, we've thought through the risks:

**Akahu Dependency**
_Risk:_ We rely on Akahu for bank connections.
_Mitigation:_ Strong relationship with Akahu team. Manual entry always available as fallback. Watching for alternative providers as market matures.

**Competition**
_Risk:_ Larger players could enter the NZ market.
_Mitigation:_ First-mover advantage. Coaching philosophy is hard to copy. Community and brand loyalty. Kids Module creates switching cost.

**User Acquisition Cost**
_Risk:_ Paid acquisition can be expensive.
_Mitigation:_ Community-led growth. Referral incentives. Content marketing for organic discovery. B2B channel reduces CAC.

**Churn**
_Risk:_ Users might try and leave.
_Mitigation:_ Achievement system creates engagement loops. Life features (shopping, meals) make us daily-use. Kids Module locks in families.

**Economic Downturn**
_Risk:_ Subscription fatigue in tough times.
_Mitigation:_ Generous free tier keeps users engaged. Budgeting apps often see increased demand during downturns.

Smart investors know every startup has risks. Here's how we're thinking about ours."

---

## Slide 23: Closing

**Let's Help Kiwis Get Sorted**

_One calm budget at a time_

"Almost three-quarters of Kiwis feel stressed about money. Most will never try a budgeting app because they think they're not 'money people.'

Here at My Budget Mate, we change that. We meet people where they are. I coach, not judge. I celebrate progress, not perfection.

We're not building another budgeting app. We're breaking the taboo around money and starting a new conversation - one that anyone can have openly, without shame. Singles taking control. Partners planning together. Parents/caregivers teaching kids.

We're building confidence, one achievement at a time. And with the Kids module, we're raising a generation that grows up financially fluent - where talking about money is as normal as talking about the weather.

I'm Remy, and I'm in your corner.
